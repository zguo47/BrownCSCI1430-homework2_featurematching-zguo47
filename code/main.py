     1) Load stuff
     There are numerous other image sets in the supplementary data on the
     homework web page. You can simply download images off the Internet, as
     well. However, the evaluation function at the bottom of this script will
     only work for three particular image pairs (unless you add ground truth
     annotations for other image pairs). It is suggested that you only work
     with the two Notre Dame images until you are satisfied with your
     implementation and ready to test on additional images. A single scale
     pipeline works fine for these two images (and will give you full credit
     for this homework), but you will need local features at multiple scales to
     handle harder cases.

     If you want to add new images to test, replace the two images in the 
     `custom` folder with your own image pairs. Make sure that the names match 
     the ones in the elif for the custom folder. To run with your new images 
     use python main.py -d custom.

    :param file_name: string for which image pair to compute correspondence for

        The first four strings can be used as shortcuts to the
        data files we give you

        1. notre_dame
        2. mt_rushmore
